Programming  Assignment 3

Write a program to calculate the volume and surface area (including the ends) of a cylinder. Units are not required. 

• Inputs: radius and height of cylinder
• Outputs: volume and surface area, where v = πr2h and s = 2πr(r+h). Display the results using 5 digits after the decimal point.
• Testing: Run the program for the three cases shown below.


Case	r	h
1		5	10
2		25	5
3		34	2.6
