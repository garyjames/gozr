Programming Assignment 5


ATM Machine Phase 1

In this assignment you will create a program that allows a user to do the following:

1) Create a bank account by supplying a user id and password.
2) Login using their id and password.
3) Quit the program.

Now if login was successful the user will be able to do the following:

1) Withdraw money.
2) Deposit money.
3) Request balance.
4) Quit the program.

If login was not successful (for example the id or password did not match) then the user will be taken back to the introduction menu.

This is what your program in action will look like:

d 	-> Deposit Money
w -> Withdraw Money
r  -> Request Balance

Thanks for stopping by!


Phase 1 of this project will require you complete the code found on the next page. 


// CODE STARTS HERE
       
       #include <iostream.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>

	// function prototypes
       void printIntroMenu();
       void printMainMenu();
       void start();
       void login();
       void createAccount();
       
       // global variable (use this variable to store the user’s menu selection)
       char menuInput;
       
       // the main function
       int main()
       {
       	// TO WRITE A WELCOME MESSAGE HERE

		// call the function start
		start();

		return 0;
       }

void printIntroMenu()
       {
       	// WRITE CODE HERE
       }
       
void printMainMenu()
       {
       	// WRITE CODE HERE
       }
       
       void start()
       {
       	// EXPLANATION OF CODE THAT GOES HERE IS BELOW
       }
       
       void createAccount()
       {
       	// PHASE 2
       }
       
       void login()
       {
       	// PHASE 2
       }

// CODE ENDS HERE


The function printIntroMenu() displays the following:

	Please select an option from the menu below:

l 	-> Login
c -> Create New Account
       q -> Quit
       
       > 
       

The function printMainMenu() displays the following menu:

d 	-> Deposit Money
w 	-> Withdraw Money
r 	-> Request Balance
q 	-> Quit

       >
       
       
The function start() does the following:

1) Displays the following message, “Please select an option from the menu below: ”

2) Displays the introduction menu. Do this by calling the function you created earlier, printIntroMenu()

3) Program halts and waits for the user to make their selection. Use the cin >> function to accomplish this step. 

4) Now use a switch statement to do the following:
If the user types the character ‘l’ then the function login() is called
If the user types the character ‘c’ then the function createAccount() is called.
If the user types ‘q’ your program will terminate by calling the function exit(0)
