Programming Assignment 8

Check Alphabet or Not in C++

To check whether the entered character is an alphabet or not an alphabet in C++ programming, 
you have to ask to the user to enter a character and start checking for alphabet. To check for alphabet, 
use ASCII values of character, if character has ASCII values between 65 to 92 or 97 to 122 then 
it will be an alphabet. Otherwise, it will not be an alphabet.

You can also check whether the character is in between a to z(alphabet) or A to Z(alphabet). Otherwise, 
not an alphabet as shown here in the following program.
