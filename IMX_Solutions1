With the supposition that ICD_Code = 123 refers to Diabetes related claims and Date values are formatted as YYYYMMDD.

select t2.date, avg(t2.cost_claim) as Avg_Daily_Cost
from table1 t1, table2 t2
where t1.claim_number = t2.claim_number and
  t1.icd_code = 123 and
  t2.date >= 20190228 and t2.date <= 20200331
group by t2.date

Need clarification to proceed.

The instructions say to get the "volume of pharmacy claims" which implies the
number of drugs asked per patient. Does that mean that there is a 1:1
relationship between a client claim and a drug_code? In other words, can a
claim_number have only one pharmacy claim (i.e. drug_code)? If so, then I can
safely assume each claim_number will have only one drug claim (drug_code).

But, if a claim_number can have multiple drug_codes (the doctor prescribes more
than one drug per claim), then there is no way to tie a claim to multiple
drug_code(s). thanks.

IP whitelisting will only allow access to applications/hosts where the source
IP is known to that app/host. If the app/host doesn't recognize the IP, it will
deny connection. However, spoofing an addresses might bypass this security
measure.

When hosts are on a VPN, then only other hosts on the same VPN can access them.

When combining these two methods, then only certain IPs within that VPN will
have access to other apps/hosts/assests on that same VPN. Restricting IPs for
whitelisting from ONLY the VPN IP pool is one approach to combining these two
methods.

It comes down to "layers" of security to mitigate the probability of
attacks/break-ins, since there really isn't one solution to fit all.
